# isHere.help – User Onboarding for the AI Retail Era

**Helping Retailers & Service Businesses Onboard Users for Their New AI Systems**

As AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to transform how businesses serve customers, retailers and service providers are rolling out intelligent assistants and in-house LLM-powered platforms—hereafter referred to as **the New APP**.

Yet, adoption doesn’t happen automatically. Successful onboarding requires more than just technical orientation. It demands *real customer education*, *live demonstrations*, and *optimized usage guidance* to unlock the full potential of these powerful systems.

That’s where **isHere.help** comes in.
