# isHere.help – On-Site User Onboarding for Consumer-Facing AI Systems

**Helping Retailers and Service Businesses Guide Consumer Users Through Their New AI Tools**

As AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) enter the retail and service landscape, many businesses are launching intelligent assistants and in-house LLM-powered tools—referred to hereafter as **the New APP**.

Yet, adoption by **consumer users** isn’t automatic. They need guidance. They need to know *why* and *how* to use the New APP to solve real-life needs—and businesses need that usage to translate into commercial value.

That’s where **isHere.help** comes in—with a hands-on, **On-Site UO (User Onboarding)** program built for real-world retail and consumer-service environments.
