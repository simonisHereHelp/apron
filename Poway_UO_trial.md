# Poway UO Trial — Compassionate Associates Leading the Introduction of AI at Work  

<img src="./archive/tarot_apron.png" width="100" align="right">

Home Depot has launched a new AI tool called **Magic Apron**.  Here at **Store Poway**, we — the associates — want to try it out.

We want to start a **User Onboarding (UO)** trial to introduce this tool to customers and learn from the hands-on experience. We will focus on:

- Associate Use — How Magic Apron fits into daily work, helps reduce errors, saves time, and builds confidence.

- Customer Experience — How shoppers respond to the tool: Is it easy to use? Helpful? Would they choose to use it again?

- Business Impact — How the tool influences customer decisions, shopping speed, and basket size.

- Sale Lead — Whether this AI generate leads to higher sales.

We’re excited about this pilot — because we believe using AI can make work more rewarding for associates — and more impactful for the business.

## 2: to make a demo  

- **Level 1 — General Q&A Queries**  
  Covers quick, transactional questions typical in-store.  
  _Examples:_  
  - “What kind of paint should I use in a bathroom?”  
  - “Which drill bit works for masonry?”

  ![Level 1](./archive/hd2.png)

- **Level 2 — DeepSeek Queries**  
  Designed for high-context, high-value scenarios. These simulate a project planning conversation.  
  _Examples:_  
  - “Help me build a 10x12 deck with composite boards.”  
  - “What do I need to re-tile my kitchen floor?”
