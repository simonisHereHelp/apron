## WeAreMagic — A Trial Led by Associates to Bring AI Into Daily Store Work  

<img src="./archive/tarot_apron.png" width="100" align="right">

Home Depot has a new AI tool called Magic Apron.  

At **Store Poway**, we — the associates — want to try it out and see how it can help in real store situations.

We're running a **User Onboarding (UO)** trial to introduce this tool to customers and learn from the experience.

We will share findings in two key areas:

- 🧡 How Magic Apron can **support associates** — by making work easier and building confidence  

- 📈 How it can **help the store grow** — by giving customers better answers and increasing sales

We’re calling this trial **WeAreMagic** — because we believe AI can make our work more helpful, more efficient, and more rewarding.

**WeAreMagic**: Exploring how this tool can support our daily work and boost store revenue.

## 2: to make a demo  

- **Level 1 — General Q&A Queries**  
  Covers quick, transactional questions typical in-store.  
  _Examples:_  
  - “What kind of paint should I use in a bathroom?”  
  - “Which drill bit works for masonry?”

  ![Level 1](./archive/hd2.png)

- **Level 2 — DeepSeek Queries**  
  Designed for high-context, high-value scenarios. These simulate a project planning conversation.  
  _Examples:_  
  - “Help me build a 10x12 deck with composite boards.”  
  - “What do I need to re-tile my kitchen floor?”

> 💡 DeepSeek = greater store revenue!
